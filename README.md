# Hackathon Prep Readme

This project is a JavaFX program for testing haar cascade classifiers generated with the OpenCV tools found here: https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html



# Overview

The overarching idea is to generate cascade classifier models that will be used to identify occupied and unoccupied office desks on a given image using OpenCV DNN algorithms. This repository contains the code to build the cascade visualization tool which will be used for debugging the training of the classification model. It is not the actual code that will be part of the Hackathon deliverable.
